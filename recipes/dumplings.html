    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> Dumplings are small, savoury parcels of dough filled with a variety of ingredients, often enjoyed steamed, boiled, or pan-fried. Their soft, delicate wrappers hold a juicy mixture that can include minced meat like pork, chicken, or beef, along with finely chopped vegetables such as cabbage, spring onions, and garlic chives. When cooked, the wrappers become tender and slightly chewy, creating the perfect contrast to the rich, flavourful filling inside. Each bite bursts with a comforting blend of umami, spice, and freshness. </p>

    <p> Often served with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, and a touch of chilli oil or sesame, dumplings are a staple in many Asian cuisines, particularly Chinese. They can be shaped in different styles — from crescent moon to pleated purses — and are usually shared at family gatherings or festive celebrations. Whether served in bamboo steamers or crispy from a hot pan, dumplings are beloved for their satisfying texture, comforting warmth, and the way they bring people together over shared plates. </p>
