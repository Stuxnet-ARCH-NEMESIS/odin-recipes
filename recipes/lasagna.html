    <h1> Lasagna Recipe </h1>

    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> Lasagna is a hearty, layered pasta dish that’s rich in flavour and comfort. It features sheets of tender pasta stacked between generous layers of slow-cooked meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. The meat sauce is usually a savoury blend of minced beef or pork, simmered with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs like oregano and basil, creating a deep, aromatic base. The béchamel adds a smooth, velvety contrast that balances the richness of the meat, while grated cheese—often mozzarella or parmesan—melts into gooey, golden bubbles on top. </p>

    <p> When baked, the lasagna transforms into a bubbling, golden-brown casserole with crisp edges and a soft, saucy centre. Each slice reveals a cross-section of flavours and textures: the bite of the pasta, the tangy warmth of tomato, the richness of meat, and the creamy softness of the white sauce. It’s a dish that feels like a warm hug—filling, familiar, and always satisfying. Often served with a side of salad or crusty bread, lasagna is a classic that brings people together at the table. </p>
