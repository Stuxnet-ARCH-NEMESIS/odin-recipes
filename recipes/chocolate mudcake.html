    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> A chocolate mudcake is a dense, rich dessert known for its deep chocolate flavour and moist, fudgy texture. Its appearance is often dark and glossy, with a thick, smooth crumb that almost melts in your mouth. Unlike lighter sponge cakes, a mudcake feels heavy and luxurious, with each slice offering a satisfying, slow chew that lingers with bittersweet cocoa notes. The outside often has a slight crust, while the inside remains decadently soft and almost brownie-like. </p>
    
    <p> This cake is typically topped with a velvety chocolate ganache that enhances its richness and adds a glossy finish. The ganache seeps slightly into the cake, making each bite even more indulgent. Chocolate mudcake is often served at celebrations because of its ability to stay moist for days, even improving in flavour over time. It pairs beautifully with whipped cream, berries, or just a hot drink, making it a favourite for chocoholics and dessert lovers alike. </p>
